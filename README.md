This project was part of the second-year, second-semester ITP Module at SLIIT. The project's objective was to design an admin panel tailored explicitly for the management of a resort. The admin panel was created to handle eight key functions essential for the smooth operation of the resort. Through meticulous planning and implementation, the team successfully developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enables administrators to efficiently manage tasks such as staff management, inventory control, report generation, and other essential functions.
